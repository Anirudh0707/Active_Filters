Anirudh B H (16EC105) <br>

This was part of the Active Filters Course project <br>
The Project involved the implementation of a 5th order Low Pass Butterwoth filter <br>

1) A purely passive 5th order low pass butterworth filter was implemented <br>
   Specifications : Ladder Circuit <br>

2) An ideal GmC version of the 5th order Butterworth Filter was implemented <br>
   Specifications(gm) : 1mS <br>

3) A fully differential transconductance amplifier was made using MOSFETs <br>
   Specifications: Gate Overdrive : 200mV  <br>
                   Transconductance(gm) : 1mS <br>

4) The fully diffrential transconductor blocks were used to implement the GmC version of the 5th Order Filter <br>
